		<p>simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. </p>
		<p>It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of  <em>Letraset</em> sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
